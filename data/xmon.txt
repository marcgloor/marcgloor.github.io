SYNOPSIS
       xmon [-s speed] [-p window position] [-w window size] [-h help]


DESCRIPTION
       xmon  is  a  minimalist graphical performance monitor for Linux. Origi-
       nally developed in 1998 and modernized in 2026, it provides a real-time
       visual scrolling display of CPU, Memory, and  System  Load  by  reading
       data directly from the Linux /proc filesystem.

       -d timer <sec>
              Set self-destruct timer (default: not set)

       -p window placement <x,y>
              Set initial window position (default: 100,100)

       -s speed <ms>
              Set refresh speed (default: 50ms)

       -w window size <WxH>
              Set initial window size (default: 300x107)

       -h     Show this help message

       You can find color codes usually by using the command 'showrgb' oder

              In/Out effects.

       -      Label Collision Evasion: Logic to prevent overlapping labels and
              fixed string literal escaping.

       -      Elastic  Mesh  Architecture:  Full  window  responsiveness  that
              adapts to any aspect ratio.

              'parking dock' when values drop below 10%.

       -      Continuous Motion: Smooth graph movement  replaces  legacy  dis-
              crete jumping and jittering.


CONTROLS
       + / -  Adjust rendering speed dynamically during execution.

       Any key
              Displays  rendering  time  that shows the time it needs to cross
              right-to-left border.
              Cycle time shows the time interval between the start of two  up-
              dates.
              Speed represents the number of cycles that occur within one sec-
              ond.
