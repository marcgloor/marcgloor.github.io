<p><b>Instructions howto access the storage of the Casio Exilim digital
cam</b> </p>
<p>Are you owner of the Casio Exilim digital camera? You don't get any
drivers for using the USB cam under Windows NT? You don't like to run
Windows at all? Do you prefer running Linux kernel series 2.2. but the
related patchlevel doesn't include a fully working USB stack? Don't
worry, there are several ways accessing the storage of the Exilim
depending the Linux kernel patchlevel. <br>

<p>There are several ways accessing your Casio Exilim: </p>
<ul>
  <li> using the mass storage driver on kernel 2.2. together with a <i>USB
backport</i> and the Casio USB <i>nonconformance workaround</i></li>
  <li> using the mass storage driver on kernel 2.4. (without <i>backpatches</i>
and <i>workarounds</i>)</li>
  <li> using the mass storage driver after booting a kernel 2.4. Linux
distribution from CD-ROM (the easiest way)</li>
  <li> using the mass storage driver on kernel 2.4. by temporary booting
a kernel 2.4. image without distribution migration</li>
  <li> using <i>libusb</i> and the <i>gphoto2</i> software on a well
configured and fully working USB bus</li>
  <li> accessing the cam without upgrading to kernel 2.4. using vmware
and knoppix by using the mass storage driver (untested)</li>
  <li> feel free to <a href="mailto:marc_dot_gloor_at_u_dot_nus_dot_edu">report</a> other
solutions</li>
</ul>

<b>The kernel 2.2. marathon</b> </p>
<p>If you are using a 2.2. kernel series, unfortunately you have to
compile a new operating system using the <a
 href="http://www.suse.cz/development/usb-backport/">USB backpatch</a>
(v2.2 Linux USB drivers backport) from kernel series 2.4 which was
backported to older kernels. The problem (in my opinion) is that the
backport is not updated regularly which means that the newest USB code
is missed inside the backpatch. The Casio Exilim series are not
conformant to the USB storage specification - as a result of this,
accessing the camera will fail. Harald Schreiber contributed a <a
 href="http://www.harald-schreiber.de">patch</a> (Linux USB Support for
Casio QV and Exilim Digital Still Cameras) to the kernel 2.4. version,
this patch will workaround and handle the problem inside the USB stack
(thanks to Harald for this important workaround). If you don't intend
to upgrade to kernel major 2.4 for running the cam under Linux, the
only way I see is to backport Harald's Casio <a
 href="http://www.harald-schreiber.de">patches</a> to the <a
 href="http://www.suse.cz/development/usb-backport/">USB backpatch</a>
from major 2.2. kernel series USB backport and try to get it work. It
seems to me that this needs a lot of knowledge about programming the
USB stack as well as kernel hacking skills and a lot of time. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>The kernel 2.4 solution</b> </p>
<p>Believe me, if you really like to use your Exilim cam under Linux
(because of the nonconformance of the Casio mass storage
implementation), <u>you have to use</u> a majorseries 2.4. kernel (imho
support beginning from 2.4.18), the reason is that the USB stack in
2.4. was officially patched by Harald Schreibers Casio workarounds.
Because I prefer to run Debian GNU/Linux, I don't like to migrate
(upgrade) my systems just for using the digital cam regularly. If you
are in the same situation, no worries. You don't have to migrate your
whole environment to 2.4. straightly. There are several interim
possibilities for having access to the memory of the Casio digicam: </p>
<p>If you're using Debian GNU/Linux (like me), there is an additional
way to get the Exilim digital cam work under Linux. Adrian Bunk offered
some <a href="http://www.fs.tum.de/%7Ebunk/kernel-24.html">debian
packages</a> ready for downloading and upgrading your Debian to major
release 2.4 without replacing related packages manually. I didn't
tested this yet, but it is a way to get a 2.4. system running. </p>
<p>However, after successfully migrate or upgrade your distribution to
kernel 2.4. you have to be sure that your kernel has enabled following
feautures additionally to your convenient settings: </p>
<ul>
  <li> SCSI</li>
  <li> SCSI hard disk</li>
  <li> VFAT</li>
  <li> USB</li>
  <li> USB mass storage</li>
</ul>
If you don't use a monolithic kernel and if you are using modules, I
strongly recommend to use the hotplug USB manager. For testing if the
USB hub was recognized successfully, use the <tt>dmesg</tt> command and
grep for lines containing <tt>usb</tt>. In addition, the output of <tt>/proc/bus/usb/devices</tt>
should list the cam after the recognition was successfull. Next step is
to create a mount point for the filesystem e.g. <tt>mkdir -p /mnt/cam</tt>.
Then you should be able to mount the cam by using the command <tt>mount
-t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/cam</tt> for accessing the images by going in
this directory. Additionally, add following lines to your filesystem
table <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>:
<blockquote><tt>none&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/proc/bus/usb&nbsp; usbdevfs&nbsp;&nbsp;
defaults&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 0</tt> <br>
  <tt>/dev/sda1&nbsp; /mnt/cam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
vfat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ro,noauto,user&nbsp;&nbsp;
0&nbsp; 0</tt></blockquote>
Another way accessing the data is the use of <a
 href="http://www.gphoto.org"><i>libusb</i> and the <i>gphoto2</i>
software</a> (on a well configured and fully working USB bus) instead of
using the mass storage driver. Normally, If all works fine, using the
mass storage driver is more user friendly. However, there are also
additional frontends (imho written in Gtk+) available for having access
to the cam through the library and the commandline utility. For more
information about setting up the cam this way visit Christian Albers <a
 href="http://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/%7Ealbers/computer/ixus-linux.html">website</a>.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><b>The kernel 2.4. interim solution No.1 (quick-and-dirty)</b> </p>
<p>If you don't like to upgrade your kernel to 2.4, the easiest way
accessing the cam is by using the self booting <a
 href="http://www.knoppix.de">knoppix Linux distribution</a> from
CD-ROM. After booting from CD, the system is up in 2 minutes by running
a <u>full featured 2.4. kernel</u> supporting all you need for having
access to your Casio Exilim digital camera. For connecting knoppix to
your network, the network configuration has been done quickly. Using a
network, there are ways to export the pictures to a NFS server or just
by sending the data via FTP to a destination server. After
successfullly copying the images to a another location, a reboot
without CD-ROM will startup your common Linux distribution. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>The kernel 2.4. interim solution Nr.2 (my way)</b> </p>
<p>Another way accessing the Exilim without migrating a Linux
distribution up to 2.4. is to get a kernel 2.4.x image from a <a
 href="http://mirrors.kernel.org/">kernel mirror</a>, configure and
install the new system and mount the cam via mass storage driver from
the USB stack. I currently use <a
 href="ftp://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/mirror/linux/kernel/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.9.tar.gz">kernel
image 2.4.9</a> and it works fine as interim solution for dowloading the
images from my cam. The only disadvantage is that the system must be
rebootet before downloading the images to the local disk. </p>
