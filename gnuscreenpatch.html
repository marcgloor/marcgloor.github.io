    <p><b>The problem<br>
      </b>When you detach a <a
        href="https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=screen">GNU Screen</a>
      session version 4.99 (C-a d), the only way to re-attach the
      session (screen -r &lt;session&gt;) is by unlocking the session
      using a password. There are situations where you don't like to be
      forced to use passwords e.g. in a passwordless intranet or test
      environment.<b><br>
        <br>
        My issue with current GNU screen versions shipped with most
        linux distributions</b><br>
      I had to use the most recent screen version from github due to the
      fact that this was the only way that <a
        href="https://github.com/aristocratos/bashtop">bashtop</a> was
      displayed properly within a screen session. A rotating monitoring
      script that I wrote autonomously switches between 4 detached
      screen sessions in a 5 sec (re-attaching) interval. After
      investigating a while, I couldn't figure out a way using the docs
      to disable GNU screen's password prompt when re-attaching a
      detached session. My rotation script's intention was spoiled with
      this screen 'force password' feature so I decided to take action
      against it to workaround my issue.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>The issue with latest GNU Screen 4.99</b><br>
      From ChatGPT I learnt, that in <a
        href="https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=screen">GNU Screen</a>
      4.99, the ability to disable passwords was removed, and there is
      no straightforward configuration option to achieve this. Password
      authentication is now enforced by default in GNU Screen 4.99 and
      later versions. If you require a passwordless screen session, one
      possible workaround is to downgrade to an earlier version of GNU
      Screen that still supports disabling passwords. However, keep in
      mind that downgrading software versions may have other
      implications and could introduce potential security
      vulnerabilities. Alternatively, you may consider exploring
      alternative terminal multiplexer options that provide passwordless
      session management, such as tmux.<br>

      </code><b>Note<br>
      </b>Not sure ChatGPT's proplem analysis was trustworthy. For me,
      it was the only root-cause I could determine and foundation to the
      problem resolution of my issue. This page provides you with an
      unofficial <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=screen">GNU


        Screen</a> <a href="data/screen-git-nopasswd-patch.tar.gz">
        patch</a> that removes the forced password feature when
      re-attaching sessions. Note, that the password functionality in
      GNU screen <u>should</u> be generally available, so that screen
      sessions can be locked when away from the screen for a while.
      Entirely killing this security feature is <u>not</u> the correct
      way to handle this. My patch is a temporary workaround. I
      initially contacted the maintainers/developers on 24th of May 2023
      about this and opened a <a
        href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?64254">bug report
        #64254</a> in order to verify that this is intended behaviour. <font
